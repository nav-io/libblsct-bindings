`libblsct-bindings` provides multi-language bindings for
[navio-core](https://github.com/nav-io/navio-core)'s BLS Confidential
Transactions (BLSCT) library.

BLSCT enables **confidential transactions** on the Navio blockchain - amounts
and recipient addresses are hidden on-chain using BLS12-381 elliptic curve
cryptography and range proofs. These bindings expose the key derivation,
sub-address generation, address encoding, and transaction construction
primitives needed to build wallets and integrations in your language of choice.

## Requirements

All language bindings require the native `libblsct` shared library to be
available on your system:

- Linux: `libblsct.so`
- macOS: `libblsct.dylib`
- Windows: `blsct.dll`

See [navio-core](https://github.com/nav-io/navio-core) for build instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Each language binding lives under `ffi/<lang>/` and
has its own README with build and test instructions. Before submitting a PR:

- Run the test suite for the language you changed
- Ensure the SWIG interface files (`blsct.i`) stay in sync across Python and
  TypeScript (checked by CI)
- Follow the existing code style for that language
